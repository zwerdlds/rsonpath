Library for [`rsonpath`](https://crates.io/crates/rsonpath), the JSONPath engine for querying massive streamed datasets.

The main target of this crate is the `rsonpath` CLI tool. Note that this API is unstable until we reach
v1.0.0.

## Unsafe

The library uses `unsafe` for SIMD operations, because it has to, at least until `portable-simd` gets stabilized.
Because of this, a compiled library is *not* portable &ndash; if you build on a platform supporting
AVX2 and then use the same compiled code on an ARM platform, it will crash.
We put special care to not use `unsafe` code anywhere else &ndash; in fact, the crate uses `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`
when compiled without the default `simd` feature.

## Build & test

The dev workflow utilizes [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).
Use the included `Justfile`. It will automatically install Rust for you using the `rustup` tool if it detects there is no Cargo in your environment.

```bash
just build
just test
```

## Architecture diagram

Below is a simplified overview of the module interactions and interfaces,
and how data flows from the user's input (query, document) through the pipeline to produce results.

## Dependencies

Showing direct dependencies.

```bash
cargo tree --package rsonpath-lib --edges normal --depth 1
```

<!-- rsonpath-lib dependencies start -->
```ini
rsonpath-lib v0.4.0 (/home/mat/rsonpath/crates/rsonpath-lib)
â”œâ”€â”€ aligners v0.0.10
â”œâ”€â”€ cfg-if v1.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ log v0.4.17
â”œâ”€â”€ memchr v2.5.0

### Justification

- `aligners` &ndash; SIMD operations require correct input data alignment, putting those requirements at type level makes our code more robust.
- `cfg-if` &ndash; used to support SIMD and no-SIMD versions.
- `log` &ndash; diagnostic logs during compilation and execution.
- `memchr` &ndash; rapid, SIMDified substring search for fast-forwarding to specific members.
- `nom` &ndash; for parser implementation.
- `replace_with` &ndash; for safe handling of internal classifier state when switching classifiers.
- `smallvec` &ndash; crucial for small-stack performance.
- `thiserror` &ndash; idiomatic `Error` implementations.
- `vector_map` &ndash; used in the query compiler for measurably better performance.
